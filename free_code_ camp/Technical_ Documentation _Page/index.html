          <p>The level of trust you put in a certificate is connected to how much you trust the organization and th
            e certificate authority. If the web address matches the address on the certificate, the certificate is signed by 
            a trusted certificate authority, and the date is valid, you can be more confident that the site you want to visit is 
            actually the site that you are visiting. However, unless you personally verify that certificate's uni
            que fingerprint by calling the organization directly, there is no way to be absolutely sure.</p>

        There are two ways to verifyl
         <code>technologies</code> 
          a web site's certificate in Internet Explorer or Firefox. One option is to click on the padlock icon. 
          However, your browser settings may not be configured to display the status bar that contains the icon. 
          Also, attackers may be able to create malicious websites that fake a padlock icon and 
          display a false dialog window if you click that icon. A more secure way to find information 
          about the certificate is to look for the certificate feature in the menu options. 
          This information may be under the file properties or the security option within the page information. 
          You will get a dialog box with information about the certificate, including:

        <p>Who issued the certificate – You should make sure that the issuer is a legitimate, truste

          own certificate authorities that they use to issue certificates to internal sites such as intranets.

            certificate should be issued to the organization who owns the web site. 
            Do not trust the certificate if the name on the certificate does not match the name of the organization or person you
            expect.

            Expiration date – Most certificates are issued for one or two years. One exception is the certificate for the certificate
             authority itself, which, because of the amount of involvement necessary to distribute the information to all of the 
             organizations who hold its certificates, may be ten years. Be wary of organizations with certificates that are
              valid for longer than two years or with certificates that have expired.
